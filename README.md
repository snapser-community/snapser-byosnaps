# Snapser - Bring your own Custom Code Examples

Welcome to the Snapser - Bring your own Custom Code Examples Repo. Here you will find examples
we have created to exhibit the behavior and usage of BYOSnaps. We will continue adding more examples,
to this repo but are also open to our community adding their examples to this repo.

## Examples
1. [Go Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-go)
  - An example that shows how your custom code can talk to other snaps via gRPC within your Snapser backend.
2. [Python Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-python)
  - A simple BYOSnap that exposes a couple RESTful endpoints.
3. [C# Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/ByoSnapCSharp)
  - A simple BYOSnap that exposes a RESTful endpoint.
4. [Custom Events Example (Go)](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-rewards)
  - An example of how a BYOSnap can emit custom events based on an API call to a BYOSnap endpoint.

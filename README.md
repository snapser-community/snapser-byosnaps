# Snapser - Bring Your Own Custom Code Examples

Welcome to the Snapser Repository for Bring Your Own Custom Code Examples. This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase for various examples demonstrating the capabilities and integration possibilities of BYOSnaps within the Snapser backend. We are committed to continually expanding this collection with more innovative examples.

We also encourage contributions from our vibrant community. If you have developed a unique implementation or enhancement, feel free to share it here!

## Examples

Below are some of the examples available in this repository:

1. **[Go Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-go)**
   Demonstrates how your custom code can communicate with other snaps via gRPC within your Snapser backend.

2. **[Python Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-python)**
   A basic BYOSnap that exposes a couple RESTful endpoints.

3. **[C# Example](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/ByoSnapCSharp)**
   Showcases a simple BYOSnap designed to expose a RESTful endpoint.

4. **[Custom Events Example (Go)](https://github.com/snapser-community/snapser-byosnaps/tree/main/byosnap-rewards)**
   WIP - An illustrative example of how a BYOSnap can emit custom events in response to an API call to a BYOSnap endpoint.
